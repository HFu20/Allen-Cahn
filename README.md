This is the Matlab code for the paper "ENERGY DISSIPATION LAW AND MAXIMUM BOUND PRINCIPLE-PRESERVING LINEAR BDF2 SCHEMES WITH VARIABLE STEPS FOR THE ALLEN–CAHN EQUATION", by Bingyin Zhang, Hongfei Fu, Rihui Lan, and Shusen Xie.  A linear, structure-preserving scalar auxiliary variable (SAV)
method for solving the Allen–Cahn equation based on the BDF2 formula with variable time steps is developed.
